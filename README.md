Deliverable D1.3 - Privacy Aware Storage and Miner

DoW Excerpts:

* T1.4 PM7-24
In this task we will develop a data store using an approach of Privacy-by-Design. First, we will
apply information security risk assessment techniques (e.g. OCTAVE) to identify the main legal and ethical risks 
of collecting and mining privacy data and appropriate technical countermeasures. Implementation of countermeasures 
will focus on: (a) the use of authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure that there is not 
inappropriate access to data of individuals and (b) use of (pseudo-)anonymisation techniques so data that 
indentifies individuals can be separated from the data needed in sensor log data analyses. Particularly relevant 
for the Live+Gov store that contains private sensed data is the conflicting need of having private data that 
however needs to be republished in appropriate ways. For such purpose, recent years have seen the development 
of obfuscation and randomization methods to ensure privacy, that will be used here to protect all individuals concerned. 
Before mining occurs in the Live+Gov backend, data will be randomized using the paradigm of privacy preserving 
data mining, where specific user input is distorted in ways that retain the validity of the analysis without 
retaining the accuracy of data from individuals.

Privacy Aware Sensor Data Storage and Miner: This deliverable will provide the server based reality
sensing infrastructure for Live+Gov applications. In line with WP1 requirements, this component will provide
appropriate anonymization techniques and dynamic contextualization methods for user support in eGovernance
scenarios. [month 24]
